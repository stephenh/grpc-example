Design Thought Process
======================

I really like schema-driven APIs, so considered:

* Swagger, which would provide more REST-native across lots of languages. Would be a good choice but I've not used it before.
* GraphQL, like the idea, but seems like more internal API, vs. public API, and don't need the cross-entity graph/etc. for this.
* grpc-java, which is not natively REST friendly, going with this as I've used it before.
